    <h1>Overview of <i>TEALsim</i></h1>
    <p>This package includes classes and methods for creating simulations based on Java3D</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>The TEAL simulation system, <i>TEALsim</i>, is designed as a framework for authoring, presenting, and controlling simulations in a variety of 
domains, beginning with physics.  Architecturally, TEALsim follows a <i>Model-View-Control</i> design pattern, with several major modules 
representing the three components:  the simulation engines make up the <i>model</i>; the renderer and viewer make up the <i>view</i>; 
and the user interface makes up the <i>control</i>   These three components are combined into a simulation.  
Each component is largely defined by a set of interfaces that suggest the required functionality of that piece, 
so that the actual implementation details can be customized as necessary (for example, leaving the specific 
rendering implementation up to the developer).   All major components of the system are JavaBeans. 
Most classes implement well defined interfaces, the most basic being TElement.  </p>
</p>
<p>What follows is a brief description of the basic components.  </p>


    <h2>The Simulation (TSimulation, SimEM)</h2>
    
    <p>
    Any simulation object added to a simulation must implement the TElement (java.src.teal.core.TElement) interface, 
    which provides a standard set of functionalities for all objects in the world.  That is, any object which is specified, 
    included or defined within the simulation must implement the TElement interface.  
    This includes physical objects (e.g. a point charge), graphical elements, control objects and simulation viewers.  
    In particular, the functionalities inherent in the TElement interface include support for Routes and PropertyChangeEvents.  
    This allows any simulation elements in the world to exchange information with any other element in the world, 
    and with User Interface (UI) components.  For example, a UI slider can be wired to a property of a simulation object 
    (for example, the mass of an electric point charge) to directly manipulate that quantity.  Or, the simulation 
    itself can be wired to a property of a simulation object in order to monitor that property of the object and/or take 
    some action depending on its value. 
    </p>
    <p>A completely realized TSimulation class defines the properties of the simulation as a whole, such as the initial spatial 
    configuration of simulation objects, initial conditions of any variables, and any special <i>wiring</i> between objects and/or 
    interface components.  Essentially, it contains the entire logic specific to a particular simulation.  </p>
    <p>A TSimulation object is then presented to the user using a SimPlayer, as discussed below.  </p>
    
        <h2>SimPlayer (TFramework) and SimPlayerApp</h2>
        <p>A SimPlayer (java.src.teal.app.SimPlayer) plays a TSimulation instance—that is it takes as input a TSimulation object and 
        presents that TSimulation to the viewer.  It implements the TFramework (java.src.teal.framework.TFramework) interface, 
        which is the glue that holds all of the components in the TSimulation together.  SimPlayer is the application inside 
        which all of the components of the TSimulation are running.  The TFramework interface contains methods that allow 
        loaded simulations to customize the SimPlayer application window, including modification of the UI and menu bars.  </p>
        <p>SimPlayerApp (java.src.teal.app.SimPlayerApp) contains the main routine of the TEALsim package.  
        When we run SimPlayerApp, it instantiates a SimPlayer and uses the argument </p>
        
        <p><i>-n tealsim.physics.em.ConductingSphericalShellShielding</i></p>
        
        <p>to create an instance of the class ConductingSphericalShellShielding and 
        tells the SimPlayer to play ConductingSphericalShellShielding, which is a simulation object.</p>
      <h2>SimEngine – the Simulation Engine</h2>    
      <p>The physics in a TEALsim simulation is contained in a SimEngine object  
      (java.src.teal.sim.engine.SimEngine), which represents the simulation engine itself.  
      The simulation engine is responsible for all of the computation involved in the system being simulated.  
      This includes dynamically processing and updating TSimElement simulation objects (java.src.teal.sim.TSimElement) 
      according to the rules of the simulation engine (including adding and removing them from the world when necessary), 
      and performing numerical integration of simulation variables.  The exact type of processing and integration will depend 
      on the specific type of simulation being implemented; for example, the electromagnetism extension of SimEngine, EMEngine 
      (java.src.teal.physics.em.EMEngine), computes the total electromagnetic fields created by a set of field-generating simulation objects, 
      each of which is an EMObject  (java.src.physics.em.EMObject), as well as the resulting dynamics of the set of electromagnetic objects 
      (velocity, position, rotation, etc.).  It also handles related tasks, such as collision detection and resolution.</p>
      <p>In general, the SimEngine runs a continuous loop that performs the following actions:
<ul>
<li>Computes values of dependent simulation variables for the current time step.</li>
<li>Updates simulation objects to reflect new values.</li>
<li>Informs the renderer of any visual changes to the simulation.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>This loop in the SimEngine represents the main application thread for a TEALsim simulation.</p>

              <h2>Viewer and Viewer3D – the Rendering Engine</h2>
            <p>  The Viewer (java.src.teal.render.viewer.Viewer) is the window into the simulation space, 
            representing the rendering engine and its output.  It is responsible for rendering the visual elements of a 
            simulation to the screen in real-time 3D and managing user interaction with the rendered image.  
            As such, it is tightly coupled to the SimEngine.  The SimEngine must inform the Viewer of (visual) changes to simulation elements, 
            and each visual simulation element must have an associated visual representation that can be drawn by the Viewer.  
            Conversely, the Viewer must report back to the simulation when a user manipulates the visual representation of a simulation object 
            (for example, by clicking and dragging on an object in the Viewer).</p>

<p>While the actual implementation of the Viewer can vary, the interface TViewer 
(java.src.teal.render.viewer.TViewer) defines a set of functionality that any Viewer implementation should support.  
This includes general rendering properties and tasks, such as camera controls, visual effects, maintaining lists of rendered objects, and 
handling mouse-based picking and manipulation of objects in the Viewer.  In addition, it should also handle the explicit rendering of the scene. </p>

<p>The current default Viewer implementation is based on Java3d 1.5.2, which is a scene-graph based renderer layered on top of OpenGL or DirectX.  
In this case, the Viewer sets properties on the scene graph, which is then rendered implicitly through Java3d’s rendering thread.  
A more direct (or immediate rendering implementation (such as rendering directly through OpenGL) should obviously include explicit 
rendering instructions for all visual elements.</p>

              
              
                            <h2>The User Interface</h2>
                            
                       <p>     The user interface (java.src.teal.ui) is the means by which a user interacts 
                       with the application (in addition to user interaction through the Viewer), and through which the user receives 
                       feedback about a simulation’s properties.  It is responsible for producing the types of controls and read-outs 
                       necessary to manipulate a simulation.  These can include buttons, sliders, checkboxes, combo-boxes, graphs, text 
                       fields, and numerical displays. </p>
