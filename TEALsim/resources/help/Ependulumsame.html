     	<p>The Electrostatic Pendulum Same Charge is a simulation consisting 
                          of one electric charge that is free to swing on
						  a pendulum and one stationary charge on the plate
						  below the pendulum.  <i>The two charges have the same sign.</i> You can change the charge of the swinging
						  charge compared to the stationary charge, but only do that when the
						  pendulum is just at the top of its arc, otherwise energy will not be
						  conserved through the swing.  
                          </p><br>
                        <p>Use the Start button to start simulation. Use Pause 
                          button to pause simulation. Use the 
                          slider in the panel labeled &quot;Ratio |q/Q|&quot; to 
                          change the ratio of the swinging charge to that of the fixed charge. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>The physical parameters of this pendulum are as follows: the height of the support is 25 cm, and the length of the pendulum is 20 cm.  
                        The mass of the bob with the swinging magnet is 5 grams.  The fixed charge is 0.211 micro-coulombs.  
                        </p><br>
                        <p><b>Problem:</b> Given these parameters, use conservation of energy to determine 
                        the ratio <i>q/Q</i> needed to bring the swinging charge to rest just above the fixed charge.  Answer:1.45</p>
