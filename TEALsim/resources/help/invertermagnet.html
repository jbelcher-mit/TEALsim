     	<p>The Inverter Magnet is a simulation consisting 
                          of a central magnet surrounded by six satellite magnets, all of
                          which in the same plane and are fixed in place.  An eighth magnet is free to move, but is confined to move 
                          in the plane of the other magnets.  The central magnet and the moving magnet 
                          have their poles oriented in the same direction.  The satellite magnets have 
                          their poles in the same direction but opposite to that of the central and moving magnet.

                          The moving magnet is attracted to the central magnet but repelled by the satellite magnets.  
                          The friction is initially set to zero.  If you increase the friction you will see the moving magnet settle
                          into an equilibrium position.
