     	<p>The Magnetostatic Pendulum Opposite Pole is a simulation consisting 
                          of one magnetic dipole that is free to swing on
						  a pendulum and one stationary magnet dipole on the plate
						  below the pendulum.  <i>The dipoles are both vertical and have the same
						  orientation, so that the opposite poles are facing at the bottom
						  of the swing.</i> You can change the magnetic moment of the swinging
						  dipole compared to the stationary magnet, but only do that when the
						  pendulum is just at the top of its arc, otherwise energy will not be
						  conserved through the swing.  <br><br>
                          </p>
                        <p>Use the Start button to start the simulation. Use the Pause 
                          button to pause the simulation. Use the 
                          slider in the panel labeled &quot;Ratio |m/M|&quot; to 
                          change the dipole moment of the swinging dipole compared to that of the fixed dipole. <br><br>
						</p>
						<p>The physical parameters of this pendulum are as follows: the height of the support is 25 cm, and the length of the pendulum is 20 cm.  
						 The mass of the bob with the swinging magnet is 5 grams.  The magnet moment of the fixed magnet is 10 A m^2.
						<br><br> </p>
						 <p><b>Problem:</b> Given these parameters, use conservation of energy to determine 
						 the ratio <i>|m/M|</i> so that the kinetic energy of the swinging magnet at the bottom of the swing is 
						 twice what it would be if 
						 there were no magnets.  The potential energy of a magnetic dipole is the negative of the 
						 dipole moment vector dotted into the local magnetic field.  Answer:1.225</p>
