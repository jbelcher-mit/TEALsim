     	<pp>The Inverter Magnet is a simulation consisting 
                          of a central magnet and one satellite magnet, both of
                          which are in the same plane and <i>are fixed in place.</i>  The magnetic moment of the satellite magnet 
						  is 
						  significantly smaller than that of the central magnet.  A third magnet, identical to the central magnet,
						  is free to move, but is confined to move 
                          along the line joining the first two magnets. <br><br> </p>
						  
						  The central magnet and the moving magnet 
                          have their poles oriented in the same direction, and thus repel.  The satellite magnet has 
                          its pole in the same direction but opposite to that of the central and moving magnet, and
						  thus is attracted to both.  <br><br>
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
                          The moving magnet is attracted to the central magnet but repelled by the satellite magnet.  
                          The friction is initially set to zero.  If you increase the friction you will see the moving magnet settle
                          into an equilibrium position.
