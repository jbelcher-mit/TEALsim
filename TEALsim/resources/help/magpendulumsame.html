     	<p>The Magnetostatic Pendulum Same Pole is a simulation consisting 
                          of one magnetic dipole that is free to move swinging on
						  a pendulum and one stationary magnet dipole on the plate
						  below the pendulum.  <i>The dipoles are both vertical but opposite
						  in orientation, so that the same poles are facing at the bottom
						  of the swing.</i> You can change the magnetic moment of the swinging
						  dipole compared to the stationary magnet, but only do that when the
						  pendulum is just at the top of its arc, otherwise energy will not be
						  conserved through the swing.  <br><br>
                          </p>
                        <p>Use the Start button to start simulation. Use Pause 
                          button to pause simulation. Use the 
                          slider in the panel labeled &quot;Ratio |m/M|&quot; to 
                          change the dipole moment of the swinging dipole. <br><br>
                        </p>
						<p>The physical parameters of this pendulum are as follows: the height of the support is 25 cm, and the length of the pendulum is 20 cm.  
						 The mass of the bob with the swinging magnet is 5 grams.  The magnet moment of the fixed magnet is 10 A m^2.
						 <br><br></p>
						 <p><b>Problem:</b> Given these parameters, use conservation of energy to determine 
						 the ratio <i>|m/M|</i> so that the swinging magnet comes to rest at the bottom of the swing.  
						 The potential energy of a magnetic dipole is the negative of the 
						 dipole moment vector dotted into the local magnetic field.  Answer:1.225</p>
