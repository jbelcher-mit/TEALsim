     	<p>The Magnetostatic Pendulum Same Pole is a simulation consisting 
                          of one magnetic dipole that is free to move swinging on
						  a pendulum and one stationary magnet dipole on the plate
						  below the pendulum.  The dipoles are both vertical but opposite
						  in orientation, so that the same poles are facing at the bottom
						  of the swing. You can change the magnetic moment of the swinging
						  dipole compared to the stationary magnet, but only do that when the
						  pendulum is just at the top of its arc, otherwise energy will not be
						  conserved through the swing.  
                          </p>
                        <p>Use the Start button to start simulation. Use Pause 
                          button to pause simulation. Use the 
                          slider in the panel labeled &quot;Ratio |m/M|&quot; to 
                          change the dipole moment of the swinging dipole. <br>
