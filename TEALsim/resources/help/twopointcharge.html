		<h3>This java simulation illustrates the field 
	 pattern created by two point charges with opposite signs of charge. In this simulation, 
	 the position and charge of each particle can be modified in real time, and the field 
	 configuration will update itself accordingly. </h3>
	 
	 <h3>If you hit the "Start" button, the charges will start to interact, with a lot of friction.  
	 
	 <h3>To change the position of either one of the charges, left click on the charge and drag.  </h3>

	<h3>All three field visualization techniques are used to show the overall electric 
	field of the two-charge configuration: vector field, field lines, and "grass seeds". You
	can vary the resolution of the vector field grid by using the slider.
