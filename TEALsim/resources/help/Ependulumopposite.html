     	<p>The Electrostatic Pendulum Opposite Charge is a simulation consisting 
                          of one electric charge that is free to swing on
						  a pendulum and one stationary charge on the plate
						  below the pendulum.  The two charges have opposite signs. You can change the charge of the swinging
						  charge compared to the stationary charge, but only do that when the
						  pendulum is just at the top of its arc, otherwise energy will not be
						  conserved through the swing.  
                          </p>
                        <p>Use the Start button to start simulation. Use Pause 
                          button to pause simulation. Use the 
                          slider in the panel labeled &quot;Ratio |q/Q|&quot; to 
                          change the charge of the swinging charge. <br>
